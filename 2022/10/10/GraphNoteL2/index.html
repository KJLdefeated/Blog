<h4 id="definition-2.1">Definition 2.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>walk</strong> is a sequence of vertices so that there is an edge between consecutive vertices. A walk can repeat vertices and edges.</li>
<li>A <strong>trail</strong> is a walk with no repeated edges. A trail can repeat vertices but not edges.</li>
<li>A <strong>path</strong> is a trail with no repeated vertex (or edges). A path on n vertices is denoted <span class="math inline">\(P_{n}\)</span>.</li>
<li>A <strong>closed walk</strong> is a walk that starts and ends at the same vertex.</li>
<li>A <strong>circuit</strong> is a closed trail; that is, a trail that starts and ends at the same vertex with no repeated edges though.</li>
<li>A <strong>cycle</strong> is a closed path; that is, a path that starts and ends at the same vertex. Thus cycles cannot repeat edges or vertices. A cycle on n vertices is denoted <span class="math inline">\(C_{n}\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>length</strong> of tours = number of edges.</p>
<h4 id="definition-2.2">Definition 2.2</h4>
<ul>
<li>Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be a graph. Two vertices x and y are <strong>connected</strong> if there exists a path from x to y in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. The graph <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is <strong>connected</strong> if every pair of distinct vertices is connected.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="theorem-2.3">Theorem 2.3</h4>
<ul>
<li>Every <span class="math inline">\(x-y\)</span> walk contains an <span class="math inline">\(x-y\)</span> path.
<ul>
<li><strong>Proof:</strong><br />
Prove this by induction. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> be the length of ab <span class="math inline">\(x-y\)</span> walk <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. When <span class="math inline">\(l=0\)</span>, then the walk does not have any vertices and edges so it contains a single vertex, that is $x=y and so <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is a path of length 0. Supppose <span class="math inline">\(l \ge 0\)</span> and the claim holds for true for all <span class="math inline">\(k \lt l\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> has no repeated vertex, then it cannot have any repeated edges and so <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> is an <span class="math inline">\(x-y\)</span> path. Otherwise <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> has a repeated vertex, call it <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. We can remove all edges and vertices between two appearances of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> in the ealk, and leave only one copy of <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>. This will produce a shorter <span class="math inline">\(x-y\)</span> walk <span class="math inline">\(W&#39;\)</span> which is contained in <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. Thus, by the induction hypothesis we know <span class="math inline">\(W&#39;\)</span> contains an <span class="math inline">\(x-y\)</span> path <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, which is also contained in <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(W\)</span> contains an <span class="math inline">\(x-y\)</span> path <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>.</li>

<li><span class="math inline">\((\implies)\)</span> <br> <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is eulerian. <br> <span class="math inline">\(\implies\)</span> There is a circuit <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> containing every edge and vertex of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.<br> <span class="math inline">\(\implies\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected.<br> The circuit <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is a trail that starts and ends at the same vertex.<br> <span class="math inline">\(\implies\)</span> For every vertex, there at least exists a pair of edges in and out. <br> <span class="math inline">\(\implies\)</span> Every vertex has even degree. <span class="math inline">\(\implies\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected and every vertex has even degree.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\((\impliedby)\)</span> <br> The proof processed by induction.

Let <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> be the graph obtained by deleting all the edge of <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> has less edges than <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, thus it contains an eulerian circuit. To find the eulerian circuit of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, we traverse <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> but when a component of <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> is encountered, we detour along its eulerian circuit. This detour will start and end at the same vertex, and we continue traversing <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> until all edges being traveled, thus completing an eulerian circuit of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.<br></li>

<li>Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be a graph with <span class="math inline">\(n \ge 3\)</span> vertices. If every vertex of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> satisfies <span class="math inline">\(deg(v) \ge \frac{n}{2}\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has a hamiltonian cycle.
<ul>
<li><strong>Proof:</strong> Noted that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is connected. Let <span class="math inline">\(P = x_{0}x_{1}...x_{n}\)</span> be a path that contains all vertices in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.

Since both <span class="math inline">\(x_{0}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(x_{n}\)</span> have degree <span class="math inline">\(\ge \frac{n}{2}\)</span> we know <span class="math inline">\(|S| + |T| \ge n\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(|S \cup T| \lt n\)</span>, thus <span class="math inline">\(|S \cup T| = |S| + |T| - |S \cap T|\)</span>, then we have <span class="math inline">\(|S \cap T| \ge 1\)</span>. There exists some vertex <span class="math inline">\(x_{i}\)</span> s.t. <span class="math inline">\(x_{0}x+{i+1},x_{i}x_{n} \in E(G)\)</span>.
